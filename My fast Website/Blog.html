        <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2022</h2>
        <p>There are days when all we ever encounter are roadblocks, preventing us from moving forward. 
            The moments when our dreams seems so out of reach make us wonder if it’s truly worth pursuing or fighting for.
            However, the challenges we face along the way are not meant to make us quit and just spend the rest of our days on the 
            sidelines, being bitter about life. The challenges strewn on our paths are
             meant to test our mettle, to see if we’re made of stronger stuf
            f.</p>

            <br>

            <p>It is normal to feel anxious when we’re dealing with life or when we are pursuing our goals.
                 Nevertheless, that moment when you feel the greatest anxiety that it’s tempting to just quit is
                  the perfect occasion to keep going.
                Some people who quit going after their goals have feelings of deep regret for doing so — for 
                it is only after they’ve thrown in the towel that they realize that success was actually so close, only if they’ve persevered.

                <p>Never give up on something that you can't go a day without thinking about.” Getty Images. 2 of 20. Dale Carnegie.
                     “Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on 
                     trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.</p>

                     <br>

                     <p>No. Don't give up hope just yet. It's the last thing to go. When you have lost hope, you have
                         lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and bleak, there is always hope.”
                        ― Pittacus Lore, I Am Number Four Stay strong, stay positive, and never give up.”
                        ― Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart You may be the only person left who believes in you, 
                        but it's enough. It takes just one star to pierce a universe of darkness. Never give up.Success is not obtained overnight. 
                        It comes in installments; you get a little bit today,
                         a little bit tomorrow until the whole package is given out. The day you procrastinate, you lose that day's success.””</p>
